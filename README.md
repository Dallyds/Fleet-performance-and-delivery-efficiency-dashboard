#  🚚 AI-Powered Fleet Performance & Delivery Efficiency Dashboard
## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an AI-Powered Fleet Performance & Delivery Efficiency Dashboard built using Power BI.
The dashboard analyzes fleet operations, delivery outcomes, fuel efficiency, and cost per kilometer by combining trip-level data with vehicle master data.

The goal of this project is to help stakeholders monitor operational efficiency, identify high-cost vehicles, and improve delivery performance across destinations.
